This is delicious if you're watching your carbs, or if you need to eliminate sugar. Goat cheese is low-carb and high in protein - perfect for satisfying the cravings that are inevitable on any diet!</p>

<p>Cauliflower pizza makes an excellent substitute for those who want to satisfy their craving without all the carbs or sugar.</p>

<p>Cauliflower Pizza Crust with Goat Cheese is also kind of swanky and great for dinner parties when you want a hip entree that will make your guests think you are healthy AND cool. </p>

<p>I would recommend cauliflower rice as a substitute for any dish that you would normally use white or brown rice or white or enriched flor. Cauliflower has the same texture and is lower in carbs, so I think it's perfect for almost anything.</p>

<p>Side note: Cauliflower pizza crust tastes just as good - if not better! </p>

<p>A whole pie of this cauliflower pizza will cost you about 360 calories, which is significantly less than an equivalent portion of traditional dough (which may be over 1000 calories).</p>

<p>The ratio of protein to fat on goat cheese is excellent, with 20% being protein and 80% coming from healthy fats like omega-something something? ;) It’s also super creamy because it's made out of milk solids.</p>

<p>If you're watching your carbs, cauliflower pizza crust can be a great option because its made from cauliflower which has less carbohydrates than wheat or white flour does. The ultimate winner here is you when you try cauliflower pizza crust on your next cheat day.</p>

<p>I've been substituting cauliflower rice for white grain-based carbs like bread, pasta and potatoes in my diet for a few weeks now and I have to say that the results are better than expected. Cauliflower is an excellent source of vitamins A, Bs (thiamine), E, K as well as minerals such as potassium with its low glycemic index it's also a great option if you're watching your blood sugar levels or suffering from diabetic issues.</p>

<p>Cauliflower has a nutty taste which means no need to add extra flavorings when using it instead of traditional flour </p>

<p>Nutritionally speaking: white flour is bad because it causes inflammation  and spikes blood sugar levels. </p>

<p>White rice is made of long-grain or short-grain white rice, which has a high glycemic index and can cause an insulin surge that leads to weight gain if you're not careful with portion size. Rice also contains gluten, so it's off limits for people who have celiac disease or are intolerant to gluten, as well as anyone else wanting to avoid any form of grains altogether.</p>

<p>Cauliflower crust pizza is low in carbs (15g per serving) and higher protein than traditional dough because cauliflower contains over 20 amino acid compounds. It's one of the few vegetables in this category since most are too starchy like potatoes or tomatoes riddled with water content which makes them hard on your digestive system. </p>

<p>Cauliflower also contains over 100% of the daily recommended intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone and blood health.</p>

<p>The cauliflower crust pizza recipe in this blog post uses goat cheese to add a creaminess and distinct flavor that compliments the profile well. It's easy to take out dairy if you're vegan or lactose-intolerant by substituting with Daiya vegan cheese and using a high quality organic sauce instead.</p>

<p>You can be sure to enjoy your pizza without feeling bloated and stuffed afterwards.</p>

<p>I hope you love this cauliflower crust as much as I do! It's a party favorite and  a healthy alternative to traditional pizza crust.</p>

<p>You can be sure to enjoy your pizza without feeling bloated and stuffed afterwards.  I hope you love this cauliflower crust as much as I do! It's a party favorite and a healthy alternative to traditional pizza crust....</p>

<p>Why not have some goat cheese cauliflower pizza crust for dinner tonight? It's easy to make for the whole family. </p>

<p>Let me know what other features of the dish you'd like for me make, so I can create more healthy recipes for us all :) </p>
